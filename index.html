        <h2>About Chris</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Christopher Caressimo. I'm a Drummer and Drum instructor. I have been playing for 14 years
            of my life, and for the last five years, I have become the former drummer of a band called "Anahata" and now
            currently spending 2020 working on a new project. I have also been teaching kids from the age of 6 to 18 and
            also adults for the past 2 years at "The School of Rock" in Rockville Center and Huntington.</p>

        <h2>Past times</h2>
        <p>Outside of music, I usually spend most of my time playing video games such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Escape from Tarkov</li>
            <li>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series</li>
            <li>Path of Exile</li>
            <li>Fallout</li>
            <li>Civilization 5 & 6</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I also love to spend my time driving and working around cars. In the middle of August, I purchased a 2007
            Subaru WRX wagon which is going to my next project car to restore and modify in the future!</p>
