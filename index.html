                    <h1>Music</h1>
                    <p>For most of my life, music has played an important part in it. Whether it was for 
                       bonding with friends and family, holidays, passing the time, or helping cope with 
                       personal issue, music was always involved. I've grown up listening artist like Frank 
                       Sinatra, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Selena.<br><br> From High School on, I've developed a taste in
                       heavy music, bands like Opeth, Amon Amarth, and Gojira to name a few. Over the past five years of sharing and 
                       playing music with other people, I was introduced into Japanese metal bands such as BabyMetal, the Gazette,
                       Crystal Lake, and Maximum the Hormone, got to travel and play all over the north east,
                       and even got to perform in "Afro Punk" which included a documentary about my last band. <br><br>
                       I ended up starting new project band called "[Null]" with my two best 
                       friends at the start of 2020 which is still in the works and is not public as of yet.

                    <h1>CLOTHING</h1>
                    <p>While creating a new project with my best friends, we also decided to start up a clothing company
                       called "TrashPlxnet" focused on alternative "e-boy/e-girl" designs and styles. We have been commissioning and working 
                       with artists on designs to roll out once we finish our website and stocking up on products.

                    <h1>Games</h1>
                    <p>When I'm not playing drums or coding during my free time, I'm most likely playing video games.
                       My play style mainly revolves around Mil-sim games like ARMA, and Escape from Tarkov, and
                       survival open-world games like the Fallout series, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. I do branch out 
                       with games like Civilization 5/6, Path of Exile, and Dark Souls.

                    <h1>Cars</h1>
                    <p>I love anything about cars. My family has been heavily involved with cars, my father had a built 69' Pontiac GTO, 
                       a cousin who owns his own shop and has a radio talk show all about cars. I spent my junior and senior year of 
                       High School in a mechanics class. And I recently purchased a 07' WRX that I'm looking to restore and slightly 
                       modify. My goal is to also import a Mitsubishi Evo 5 from Japan in the next few years once it become legal.
